        <p style="margin: 0;"><strong>In data we trust? A comparison of UCDP GED and ACLED conflict events datasets</strong></p>
        <p style="margin: 0;">This paper examines the strengths and weaknesses of two prominent conflict event datasets, the UCDP Georeferenced Event Dataset (UCDP GED) and the Armed Conflict Location and Event Dataset (ACLED), which have facilitated microlevel analyses of civil war dynamics. It discusses differences in scope, definitions, and data collection processes, highlighting issues like UCDP GEDâ€™s focus on fatalities and ACLEDâ€™s inclusion of non-fatal and non-violent events. The paper uses georeferenced, disaggregated event data, primarily from Africa, detailing specific cases to evaluate coding quality and methodological challenges in both datasets.</p>
