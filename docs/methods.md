        <p style="margin: 0;">This paper examines the strengths and weaknesses of two prominent conflict event datasets, the UCDP Georeferenced Event Dataset (UCDP GED) and the Armed Conflict Location and Event Dataset (ACLED), which have facilitated microlevel analyses of civil war dynamics. It discusses differences in scope, definitions, and data collection processes, highlighting issues like UCDP GEDâ€™s focus on fatalities and ACLEDâ€™s inclusion of non-fatal and non-violent events. The paper uses georeferenced, disaggregated event data, primarily from Africa, detailing specific cases to evaluate coding quality and methodological challenges in both datasets.</p>

        <p style="margin: 0; color: purple; font-size: 1.3em; font-weight: bold;">Neural Jump-Diffusion Temporal Point Processes</p>
        <p style="margin: 0;">The paper introduces a framework that models temporal point processes (TPPs) using neural jump-diffusion stochastic differential equations (SDEs).  Motivation: Traditional TPP models often rely on predefined functional forms, which can limit their flexibility in capturing complex event dynamics. To address this limitation, the authors propose reformulating the intensity processes of TPPs as solutions to neural jump-diffusion SDEs. This approach aims to improve the model's capacity to represent intricate temporal patterns without being constrained by specific functional assumptions. Method Description: The proposed framework, termed Neural Jump-Diffusion Temporal Point Process (NJDTPP), models the intensity function of a TPP using a neural jump-diffusion SDE (NJDSDE). In this setup, the SDE's drift, diffusion, and jump coefficients are parameterized by neural networks, allowing the model to learn complex dependencies from data. This design offers theoretical guarantees regarding the existence and uniqueness of solutions to the NJDSDE. Datasets Used: The authors evaluate NJDTPP on both synthetic and real-world datasets: Synthetic Datasets: Poisson Process, Hawkes Process, Self-Correcting Process Real-World Datasets: Retweet Data, Earthquake Records, Taxi Rides, Taobao User Behavior, StackOverflow Activity, MIMIC-II Clinical Database</p>

        <p style="margin: 0; color: purple; font-size: 1.3em; font-weight: bold;">Context-Aware Spatiotemporal Event Prediction Via Convolutional Hawkes Processes</p>
        <p style="margin: 0;">They proposed a method called ConvHawkes (Convolutional Hawkes Process) that leverages image data (e.g., satellite images, weather maps) to capture the heterogeneity in external factors and determine their effect on the triggering process of events. They extend the neural network model by combining it with continuous kernel convolution and parameterize the Hawkes process intensity based on this extended model. The goal is to accurately predict spatiotemporal events by utilizing the rich external features contained in georeferenced images.

        <p style="margin: 0; color: purple; font-size: 1.3em; font-weight: bold;">Deep Mixture Point Processes: Spatio-Temporal Event Prediction With Rich Contextual Information</p>
        <p style="margin: 0;">This paper proposes a novel method called Deep Mixture Point Processes (DMPP) for predicting spatiotemporal events by incorporating rich contextual information such as weather, social activities, geographical characteristics, and traffic. The authors propose DMPP, a point process model that leverages heterogeneous and high-dimensional context available in image and text data. The intensity of the point process model is designed as a mixture of kernels, where the mixture weights are modeled by a deep neural network. This allows the model to automatically learn the complex nonlinear effects of contextual factors on event occurrence and makes analytical integration over the intensity tractable.

        <p style="margin: 0;">This paper presents a novel Neural Embedding Spatio-Temporal (NEST) point process model for spatio-temporal discrete event data and develops an efficient imitation learning-based approach for model fitting The authors propose the NEST model to capture complex spatio-temporal dependencies between discrete events using a mixture of heterogeneous Gaussian diffusion kernels. The parameters of these kernels are parameterized by neural networks. The imitation learning approach for model fitting is more robust than the maximum likelihood estimate, directly measuring the divergence between empirical distributions of training data and model-generated data. The research utilized both synthetic and real-world datasets: Synthetic Data: The synthetic datasets were generated to validate the model's capability in capturing spatial information from discrete event data. These datasets included sequences of events with varying spatial and temporal dependencies.

        <p style="margin: 0;">This paper proposes a novel deep spatio-temporal point process model called Deep Kernel Mixture Point Processes (DKMPP) that incorporates multimodal covariate information. The authors propose DKMPP, an enhanced version of Deep Mixture Point Processes (DMPP), which uses a more flexible deep kernel to model complex relationships between events and covariate data. To address the intractable training procedure of DKMPP due to the non-integrable deep kernel, they utilize an integration-free method based on score matching and further improve efficiency by adopting a scalable denoising score matching method.

        <p style="margin: 0;">This paper proposes a novel method for modeling spatiotemporal dynamical systems observed at random times and locations. The authors propose a new spatiotemporal method that effectively handles randomly sampled data. Their model integrates techniques from amortized variational inference, neural differential equations, neural point processes, and implicit neural representations to predict both the dynamics of the system and the probabilistic locations and timings of future observations. This approach aims to improve predictive accuracy and computational efficiency for modeling complex dynamical systems observed under realistic, unconstrained conditions. The research utilized several synthetic datasets generated by three commonly-used PDE systems: Burgers' System: This dataset models nonlinear 1D wave propagation. The system is simulated on a time interval [0,2] and on a spatial domain [0,1] with periodic boundary conditions. The dataset contains 10,000 trajectories, each evaluated on a uniform temporal grid with 101 time points and a uniform spatial grid with 256 nodes.

The system is simulated on a time interval [0,1] and on a spatial domain [âˆ’2.5,2.5]Â². The dataset contains 1,000 trajectories, each evaluated on a uniform temporal grid with 101 time points and a uniform 128-by-128 spatial grid. Data Link: https://github.com/esa/torchquad  Navier-Stokes System with Transport: This dataset models the spread of a pollutant in a liquid over a 2D domain.

        <p style="margin: 0;">This paper proposes a novel deep dynamics model called Deep Spatiotemporal Point Process (DeepSTPP) for learning and forecasting spatiotemporal event dynamics. The authors propose DeepSTPP, a deep dynamics model that integrates spatiotemporal point processes with deep learning. The model is designed to forecast irregularly sampled events over space and time by using a nonparametric space-time intensity function governed by a latent process. The intensity function enjoys closed-form integration for the density, and the latent process captures the uncertainty of the event sequence. The model uses amortized variational inference to infer the latent process with deep networks.  The research utilized both synthetic and real-world datasets:  Synthetic Data: The synthetic datasets were generated using Ogata's thinning algorithm and included:  Spatiotemporal Hawkes Process (STHP): This dataset models self-exciting processes where past events influence future events. It includes parameters like background event density and event influence decay over time.  Spatiotemporal Self-Correcting Process (STSC): This dataset models processes where the intensity increases between events and decreases sharply after an event. It includes parameters like background event density and negative event influence.  Real-World Data: Earthquakes Japan: This dataset contains information on the times and locations of all earthquakes in Japan between 1990 and 2020 with magnitudes of at least 2.5.

        <p style="margin: 0;">This paper proposes a new class of parameterizations for spatiotemporal point processes using Neural ODEs (Ordinary Differential Equations) to model discrete events in continuous time and space. The authors propose a method that leverages Neural ODEs to create flexible, high-fidelity models of spatiotemporal point processes. They introduce two novel neural architectures: Jump Continuous-time Normalizing Flows (Jump CNF) and Attentive Continuous-time Normalizing Flows (Attentive CNF). These architectures allow the model to learn complex distributions for both spatial and temporal domains and condition non-trivially on the observed event history. The research utilized several synthetic and real-world datasets: Pinwheel Dataset: A synthetic dataset with multimodal and non-Gaussian spatial distributions designed to test the ability to capture drastic changes due to event history. The dataset consists of 10 clusters forming a pinwheel structure, with events sampled from a multivariate Hawkes process. Data Link: This is a synthetic dataset and is not publicly available for direct download. Earthquakes Japan: This dataset contains the location and time of all earthquakes in Japan from 1990 to 2020 with magnitudes of at least 2.5. The data was gathered from the U.S. Geological Survey. Data Link: https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/search/ COVID-19 Cases in New Jersey: This dataset includes daily COVID-19 cases in New Jersey, aggregated at the county level, from March to July 2020. The data was released publicly by The New York Times. Data Link: https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data BOLD5000: This dataset consists of fMRI scans of participants given visual stimuli. Brain responses were converted into spatiotemporal events following a z-score thresholding approach. Data Link: It was released on github but is no longer available now </p>

        <p style="margin: 0;">This paper introduces a novel neural network-based non-stationary influence kernel for handling complex discrete event data. The authors propose a Neural Spectral Marked Point Process (NSMPP) model that uses a spectral decomposition of the influence kernel with a finite-rank truncation. This approach allows the model to capture non-stationary processes and high-dimensional marks, going beyond traditional stationary point processes like the Hawkes process. The model leverages neural networks to represent the kernel function, enabling it to handle complex spatiotemporal dependencies and provide theoretical performance guarantees. The research utilized both synthetic and real-world datasets: Synthetic Data: The synthetic datasets were generated to validate the model's capability in capturing non-stationary and high-dimensional kernel structures. These datasets included sequences of events with varying spatial and temporal dependencies.

        <p style="margin: 0;">This paper proposes a novel method called Recurrent Marked Temporal Point Process (RMTPP) for modeling event data with covariates using recurrent neural networks. The authors propose RMTPP to simultaneously model the event timings and the markers. The key idea is to view the intensity function of a temporal point process as a nonlinear function of the history and use a recurrent neural network (RNN) to automatically learn a representation of influences from the event history. This approach aims to improve the predictive performance for both the event type and timing compared to traditional parametric models. The research utilized both synthetic and real-world datasets: Synthetic Data: The synthetic datasets were generated to validate the model's capability in capturing temporal dynamics from discrete event data. These datasets included sequences of events with varying temporal dependencies.

        <p style="margin: 0;">This paper proposes a novel parameterization framework for Spatio-temporal Point Processes (STPPs) using diffusion models to learn complex spatio-temporal joint distributions. The authors propose a new framework called Spatio-temporal Diffusion Point Processes (DSTPP). This framework leverages diffusion models to decompose the learning of the target joint distribution into multiple steps, each described by a Gaussian distribution. The model introduces a spatio-temporal co-attention module to capture the interdependence between event time and space adaptively. This approach aims to break the restrictions on spatio-temporal dependencies in existing solutions and enable flexible and accurate modeling of STPPs.

        <p style="margin: 0;">This paper proposes a novel deep non-stationary influence kernel for modeling spatio-temporal point processes (STPPs). The authors propose a new deep non-stationary influence kernel (DNSK) that can model non-stationary spatio-temporal point processes. The main idea is to approximate the influence kernel with a novel and general low-rank decomposition, enabling efficient representation through deep neural networks. They introduce a log-barrier penalty to maintain the non-negativity constraint of the conditional intensity function, ensuring the model is statistically meaningful and numerically stable. The proposed method aims to improve computational efficiency and predictive performance compared to existing models.

        <p style="margin: 0;">This paper introduces a new discrete spatio-temporal Hawkes process model by formulating the general influence of the Hawkes process as a tensor kernel. The authors propose a discrete spatio-temporal Hawkes process model with a tensor kernel to capture the interactions between events over space and time. They formulate the estimation of the tensor kernel as a convex optimization problem using the Fourier transformed nuclear norm. The model aims to provide theoretical performance guarantees and demonstrate computational efficiency through numerical simulations on synthetic and real-world data. The research utilized both synthetic and real-world datasets: Synthetic Data: The synthetic datasets were generated to validate the model's capability in capturing spatial and temporal dependencies from discrete event data. These datasets included sequences of events with varying spatial and temporal dependencies.

        <p style="margin: 0;">This paper introduces a novel approach called Point Set Diffusion for modeling point processes on general metric spaces. The authors propose Point Set Diffusion, a diffusion-based latent variable model that can represent arbitrary point processes without relying on the intensity function. This method directly learns to stochastically interpolate between noise and data point sets, enabling efficient, parallel sampling and flexible generation for complex conditional tasks defined on the metric space. The approach aims to overcome the limitations of existing models that rely on the characteristic intensity function, which often introduces trade-offs between efficiency and flexibility.
