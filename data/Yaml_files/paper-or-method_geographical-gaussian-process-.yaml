Title: 'Geographical Gaussian Process Regression: A Spatial Machine-Learning Model
  Based on Spatial Similarity'
URL: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gean.12423
Description: This paper presents a spatial machine-learning model that integrates
  geographical Gaussian process regression with spatial similarity measures. The approach
  enhances predictive performance in spatial data analysis by accounting for spatial
  dependencies and similarities.
