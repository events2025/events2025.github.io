  Data
URL: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13253-019-00361-7
Description: This paper compares hierarchical dynamic spatio-temporal models (H-DSTMs)
  and deep neural networks for modeling complex spatio-temporal processes. It discusses
  trade-offs between interpretability and scalability, and explores hybrid models
  that combine their strengths for high-dimensional, nonlinear data.
