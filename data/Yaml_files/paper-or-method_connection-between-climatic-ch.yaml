  from Robust Long-Range Cross-Correlation and Variable-Lag Transfer Entropy with
  Sliding Windows Approach'

Description: This paper analyzes the impact of North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index
  fluctuations on global food prices using daily data (Jan 2020â€“May 2022). Applying
  advanced statistical methods, it finds significant short- and long-term correlations
  and causal links between NAO changes and major crop prices, highlighting NAO's predictive
  value for food security planning.
