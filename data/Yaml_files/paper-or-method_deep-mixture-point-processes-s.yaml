Title: 'Deep Mixture Point Processes: Spatio-temporal Event Prediction with Rich Contextual
  Information'
URL: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.08952
Description: This paper introduces DMPP (Deep Mixture Point Processes), a model for
  predicting spatio-temporal events using high-dimensional context from images and
  text. It models intensity as a kernel mixture with weights learned by a neural network
  to capture complex contextual effects.
