Title: 'A Mathematical, Classical Stratification Modeling Approach to Disentangling
  the Impact of Weather on Infectious Diseases: A Case Study Using Spatio-Temporally
  Disaggregated Campylobacter Surveillance Data for England and Wales'

Description: This paper introduces a conditional incidence method to assess weather's
  impact on infectious disease transmission, using campylobacteriosis as a case study.
  It finds a 5Â°C temperature rise (8Â°â€“15Â°C range) increases incidence by 1 case per
  million people.
