Title: Multi-Modality Spatio-Temporal Forecasting via Self-Supervised Learning
URL: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.03255
Description: This paper introduces MoSSL, a self-supervised learning framework for
  MoST data that captures latent temporal, spatial, and modality patterns while handling
  dynamic heterogeneity. Experiments on two real-world datasets show its superiority
  over state-of-the-art baselines.
