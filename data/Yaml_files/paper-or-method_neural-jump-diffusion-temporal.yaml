Title: Neural Jump-Diffusion Temporal Point Processes
URL: https://openreview.net/forum?id=d1P6GtRzuV
Description: The paper introduces NJDTPP, a framework that models TPPs using neural
  jump-diffusion SDEs to flexibly capture complex event dynamics. Neural networks
  parameterize the SDE components, and the method is evaluated on synthetic and real-world
  datasets like earthquakes, retweets, and clinical records.
