  Cases

Description: This paper proposes a Bayesian neural network model for predicting COVID-19
  cases across regions and time, incorporating mobility, spatial proximity, and temporal
  correlations. Tested on data from 245 zones in Castilla-Leon, Spain, it shows strong
  predictive performance and highlights the role of human movement and local transmission.
