Title: 'Causal Inference with Spatio-Temporal Data: Estimating the Effects of Airstrikes
  on Insurgent Violence in Iraq'
URL: https://academic.oup.com/jrsssb/article/84/5/1969/7072904?login=false
Description: This paper introduces a framework for estimating causal effects in complex
  spatio-temporal settings, combining Bayesian nonparametrics with a potential outcomes
  approach. Applied to U.S. airstrikes in Iraq (2007â€“2008), it finds local reductions
  in violence but short-term spillover increases nearby, highlighting spatial dynamics
  of intervention impact.
