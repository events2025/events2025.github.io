Title: Behaviour-Based Dependency Networks Between Places Shape Urban Economic Resilience
URL: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-024-02072-7
Description: This paper shows how business closures during disruptions affect human
  mobility and neighboring businesses. Using data from five U.S. cities, it finds
  behavior-based relationships improve resilience predictions by approximately 40%
  over distance-based models, emphasizing the role of mobility in urban economic resilience.
