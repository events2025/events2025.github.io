Title: Scalable Spatiotemporal Prediction with Bayesian Neural Fields
URL: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-51477-5
Description: This paper presents Bayesian Neural Fields (BayesNF), a model that integrates
  deep neural networks with hierarchical Bayesian inference for large-scale spatiotemporal
  data. BayesNF offers accurate predictions with uncertainty quantification and outperforms
  existing methods in domains like climate and public health. It is implemented in
  JAX with GPU/TPU support.
