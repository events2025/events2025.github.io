Unlike traditional models focused on time, DeepSTPP combines spatial and temporal dynamics using a nonparametric space-time intensity function governed by a latent process. It employs amortized variational inference with deep networks to capture event uncertainty. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that DeepSTPP outperforms state-of-the-art models in forecasting spatiotemporal events."

AutoSTPP extends dual network methods to 3D STPPs, using ProdNet's decomposable parametrization to handle computational complexity. It accurately recovers intricate intensity functions, especially for sharply localized events, as shown in experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets."
