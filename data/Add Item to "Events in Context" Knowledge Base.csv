Motivation: Traditional TPP models often rely on predefined functional forms, which can limit their flexibility in capturing complex event dynamics. To address this limitation, the authors propose reformulating the intensity processes of TPPs as solutions to neural jump-diffusion SDEs. This approach aims to improve the model's capacity to represent intricate temporal patterns without being constrained by specific functional assumptions. Method Description: The proposed framework, termed Neural Jump-Diffusion Temporal Point Process (NJDTPP), models the intensity function of a TPP using a neural jump-diffusion SDE (NJDSDE). In this setup, the SDE's drift, diffusion, and jump coefficients are parameterized by neural networks, allowing the model to learn complex dependencies from data. This design offers theoretical guarantees regarding the existence and uniqueness of solutions to the NJDSDE. Datasets Used: The authors evaluate NJDTPP on both synthetic and real-world datasets: Synthetic Datasets: Poisson Process, Hawkes Process, Self-Correcting Process Real-World Datasets: Retweet Data, Earthquake Records, Taxi Rides, Taobao User Behavior, StackOverflow Activity, MIMIC-II Clinical Database","Mouad Elhamdi","",""

The study uses data from five US cities to measure how businesses depend on each other.

Ignoring these relationships can lead to underestimating the spread of disruptions.
