The motivation behind EasyTPP is to address the lack of a standardized framework, which impedes fair comparison, reproducibility, and progress in TPP research. The tool offers a unified interface for datasets, an array of evaluation methods, implementations of popular neural TPP models, and modular components for building and extending new models, supporting both PyTorch and TensorFlow frameworks. Some of the included datasets are synthetic Hawkes process data, Amazon user reviews, NYC taxi events, Taobao user clicks, Retweet sequences, and StackOverflow badges.","/assets/images/thumb/EasyTPP.jpg"
