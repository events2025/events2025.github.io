BayesNF combines deep neural networks with hierarchical Bayesian inference to provide accurate predictions and robust uncertainty quantification. The model has demonstrated improved performance over existing methods in tasks such as forecasting and interpolation across various domains, including climate science and public health. An open-source software implementation is available, optimized for GPU and TPU accelerators via the JAX machine learning platform.","Mouad Elhamdi","/assets/images/thumb/Bayesian neural fields.jpg",""

By incorporating factors such as human mobility, spatial proximity, and temporal correlations, the model effectively captures the complex dynamics of disease spread. Applied to data from 245 health zones in Castilla-Leon, Spain, the approach demonstrates strong predictive performance, highlighting the significant influence of human movement and neighboring infection rates on COVID-19 transmission.","Mouad Elhamdi","/assets/images/thumb/Bayesian COVID19.jpg",""
