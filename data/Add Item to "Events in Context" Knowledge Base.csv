Motivation: Traditional TPP models often rely on predefined functional forms, which can limit their flexibility in capturing complex event dynamics. To address this limitation, the authors propose reformulating the intensity processes of TPPs as solutions to neural jump-diffusion SDEs. This approach aims to improve the model's capacity to represent intricate temporal patterns without being constrained by specific functional assumptions. Method Description: The proposed framework, termed Neural Jump-Diffusion Temporal Point Process (NJDTPP), models the intensity function of a TPP using a neural jump-diffusion SDE (NJDSDE). In this setup, the SDE's drift, diffusion, and jump coefficients are parameterized by neural networks, allowing the model to learn complex dependencies from data. This design offers theoretical guarantees regarding the existence and uniqueness of solutions to the NJDSDE.

The authors propose DeepSTPP, a deep dynamics model that integrates spatiotemporal point processes with deep learning. The model is designed to forecast irregularly sampled events over space and time by using a nonparametric space-time intensity function governed by a latent process. The intensity function enjoys closed-form integration for the density, and the latent process captures the uncertainty of the event sequence. The model uses amortized variational inference to infer the latent process with deep networks.  The research utilized both synthetic and real-world datasets:  Synthetic Data: The synthetic datasets were generated using Ogata's thinning algorithm and included:  Spatiotemporal Hawkes Process (STHP): This dataset models self-exciting processes where past events influence future events. It includes parameters like background event density and event influence decay over time.  Spatiotemporal Self-Correcting Process (STSC): This dataset models processes where the intensity increases between events and decreases sharply after an event. It includes parameters like background event density and negative event influence.

The authors propose a method that leverages Neural ODEs to create flexible, high-fidelity models of spatiotemporal point processes.

These architectures allow the model to learn complex distributions for both spatial and temporal domains and condition non-trivially on the observed event history.
