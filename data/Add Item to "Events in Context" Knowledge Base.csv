It offers systematic reviews, tutorials, datasets, and code to address challenges such as heterogeneous outputs, complex dependencies, and streaming data feeds. The platform provides access to a wide array of datasets across various domains, including healthcare (e.g., COVID-19 and influenza outbreaks), media (e.g., multimedia-based next action prediction), transportation (e.g., NYU Yellow Taxi datasets), engineering systems (e.g., global energy forecasting), cyber systems (e.g., cyber attack prediction), political events (e.g., civil unrests), natural events (e.g., geophysics and atmospherics), business (e.g., customer activity prediction), and crimes (e.g., global terrorism database).",""

It leverages data visualization tools, such as heatmaps and time-series plots, to analyze collision distributions across time and space and to highlight high-risk zones. The dataset used includes detailed records of motor vehicle collisions, providing information on dates, times, locations, contributing factors, and the impact on individuals involved, including injuries and fatalities.",""

The motivation behind EasyTPP is to address the lack of a standardized framework, which impedes fair comparison, reproducibility, and progress in TPP research. The tool offers a unified interface for datasets, an array of evaluation methods, implementations of popular neural TPP models, and modular components for building and extending new models, supporting both PyTorch and TensorFlow frameworks. Some of the included datasets are synthetic Hawkes process data, Amazon user reviews, NYC taxi events, Taobao user clicks, Retweet sequences, and StackOverflow badges.","/assets/images/thumb/EasyTPP.jpg"

A comparison of UCDP GED and ACLED conflict events datasets","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0010836711434463","This paper examines the strengths and weaknesses of two prominent conflict event datasets, the UCDP Georeferenced Event Dataset (UCDP GED) and the Armed Conflict Location and Event Dataset (ACLED), which have facilitated microlevel analyses of civil war dynamics. It discusses differences in scope, definitions, and data collection processes, highlighting issues like UCDP GEDâ€™s focus on fatalities and ACLEDâ€™s inclusion of non-fatal and non-violent events. The paper uses georeferenced, disaggregated event data, primarily from Africa, detailing specific cases to evaluate coding quality and methodological challenges in both datasets.",""
