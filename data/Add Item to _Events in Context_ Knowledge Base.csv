Motivation: Traditional TPP models often rely on predefined functional forms, which can limit their flexibility in capturing complex event dynamics. To address this limitation, the authors propose reformulating the intensity processes of TPPs as solutions to neural jump-diffusion SDEs. This approach aims to improve the model's capacity to represent intricate temporal patterns without being constrained by specific functional assumptions. Method Description: The proposed framework, termed Neural Jump-Diffusion Temporal Point Process (NJDTPP), models the intensity function of a TPP using a neural jump-diffusion SDE (NJDSDE). In this setup, the SDE's drift, diffusion, and jump coefficients are parameterized by neural networks, allowing the model to learn complex dependencies from data. This design offers theoretical guarantees regarding the existence and uniqueness of solutions to the NJDSDE. Datasets Used: The authors evaluate NJDTPP on both synthetic and real-world datasets: Synthetic Datasets: Poisson Process, Hawkes Process, Self-Correcting Process Real-World Datasets: Retweet Data, Earthquake Records, Taxi Rides, Taobao User Behavior, StackOverflow Activity, MIMIC-II Clinical Database","Mouad Elhamdi",""

The authors propose DKMPP, an enhanced version of Deep Mixture Point Processes (DMPP), which uses a more flexible deep kernel to model complex relationships between events and covariate data. To address the intractable training procedure of DKMPP due to the non-integrable deep kernel, they utilize an integration-free method based on score matching and further improve efficiency by adopting a scalable denoising score matching method.

The authors propose DeepSTPP, a deep dynamics model that integrates spatiotemporal point processes with deep learning. The model is designed to forecast irregularly sampled events over space and time by using a nonparametric space-time intensity function governed by a latent process. The intensity function enjoys closed-form integration for the density, and the latent process captures the uncertainty of the event sequence. The model uses amortized variational inference to infer the latent process with deep networks.
