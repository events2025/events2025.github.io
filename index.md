# 🛰️ Events in Context

An event represents any occurrence of interest at a specific point in space and time.
**🛰️ Events in Context** is a community-driven knowledge base designed to explore event data and understand events within their historical, societal, or environmental contexts. Accompanied by the literature review *"Neural Spatio-Temporal Point Processes"*, this project focuses on a practical and hands-on approach to event data analysis.

## Content
