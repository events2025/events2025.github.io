# 📡 EEL: Events in Context Library

An event represents any occurrence of interest at a specific point in space and time.
**📡 Events in Context Library** is a community-driven knowledge base designed to explore event data within their historical, societal, and environmental contexts. Complemented by the literature review [Neural Spatio-Temporal Point Processes](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.09341), this project takes a practical, hands-on approach to analyzing and understanding spatio-temporal event patterns.

## Content

1. 🔴 **Tutorials**: Introductory material on spatio-temporal event modeling, covering neural point processes, intensity estimation, and simulation. Suitable for building practical foundations.
2. 🟠 **Websites**: Links to external resources with datasets, code, and academic projects on event prediction and spatio-temporal modeling.
3. 🟡 **Tools**: Software libraries, notebooks, and platforms for data preprocessing, model fitting, and visualization in spatio-temporal analysis.
4. 🟢 **Datasets**: Curated datasets on crime, conflict, protests, and humanitarian events, with rich temporal and geographic detail for event prediction and public safety research.
5. 🔵 **Conferences and Journals**: Key venues for publishing and tracking research in spatial statistics, GIS, and spatio-temporal modeling.
6. 🟣 **Notable Papers and Methods**: Influential works on neural temporal point processes and spatio-temporal statistics, highlighting key models and empirical studies.

## Mission and Scope

Our mission is to lower entrance barriers and improve the quality of benchmarks in event data analysis. We aim to create a comprehensive resource for researchers and practitioners to access tutorials, datasets, tools, and literature in the field.
