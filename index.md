# 📡 EEL: Events in Context Library

An event represents any occurrence of interest at a specific point in space and time.
**📡 Events in Context Library** is a community-driven knowledge base designed to explore event data within their historical, societal, and environmental contexts. Complemented by the literature review [Neural Spatio-Temporal Point Processes](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.09341), this project takes a practical, hands-on approach to analyzing and understanding spatio-temporal event patterns.

## Content

1. 🔴 **Tutorials**: Easy-to-follow guides that introduce users to event processing and showcase interesting datasets of events and contextual data, such as meteorological information.
2. 🟠 **Websites**: Useful resources to help you get started in the field.
3. 🟡 **Tools**: Tools ranging from point process analysis to GIS that assist in event data processing.
4. 🟢 **Datasets**: Collections that can be used to benchmark novel methods or explore new insights.
5. 🔵 **Conferences and Journals**: Information about relevant conferences and journals in the field.
6. 🟣 **Notable Papers and Methods**: Significant publications and methodologies.

## Mission and Scope

Our mission is to lower entrance barriers and improve the quality of benchmarks in event data analysis. We aim to create a comprehensive resource for researchers and practitioners to access tutorials, datasets, tools, and literature in the field.
